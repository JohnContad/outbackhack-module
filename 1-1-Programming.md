# What is Programming?

Programming sounds hard and complicated, but it's really pretty easy - at its heart, you're just putting instructions that can be used by a computer.

Imagine this: you want pancakes, but you can't do it yourself. You need to send the instructions to someone else - maybe a friend -  who can do it for you. How you could do this is by sending a recipe that they can follow step-by step - this in essence, is what programming is.


But computers aren't people, and they can only follow specific instructions. This means that you have to be *exact* with whatever it is you want to make. Computers are dumb - they only do *exactly* what you tell them to, and in the sequence you told them to. These exact, step-by-step instructions are essentially what we call *programs*.

Computers also speak in a very specific language - a language that we can't speak directly. Because of this, our instructions need to be translated - *compiled* or *interpreted* being the actual terms. The thing that does the translation is what we call an **IDE**: short for *Integrated Development Environment*.

An *Integrated Development Environment* allows us to develop code ( or *recipes*, going back to our previous metaphor ), and have them be *translated* into something that a computer can understand. There are many types of **IDEs** out there in the wild - but for this workshop, we will be using something called the [**Arduino IDE**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

We're going to be using the Arduino IDE, because it's the IDE that can *talk to* our Arduino board.
