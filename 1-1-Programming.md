# Introduction to Programming

### What is Programming?

Programming sounds hard and complicated, but it's really pretty easy - at its heart, you're just putting instructions that can be used by a computer.

Imagine this: you want pancakes, but you can't do it yourself. You need to send the instructions to someone else - maybe a friend -  who can do it for you. How you could do this is by sending a recipe that they can follow step-by step - this in essence, is what programming is.

But computers aren't people, and they can only follow specific instructions. This means that you have to be *exact* with whatever it is you want to make. Computers are dumb - they only do *exactly* what you tell them to, and in the sequence you told them to. These exact, step-by-step instructions are essentially what we call *programs*.

### What are IDEs?

Computers also speak in a very specific language - a language that we can't speak directly. Because of this, our instructions need to be translated - *compiled* or *interpreted* being the actual terms. The thing that does the translation is what we call an **IDE**: short for *Integrated Development Environment*.

An *Integrated Development Environment* allows us to develop code (or *recipes*, going back to our previous metaphor), and have them be *translated* into something that a computer can understand. There are many types of **IDEs** out there in the wild - but for this workshop, we will be using something called the [**Arduino IDE**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

We're going to be using the Arduino IDE, because it's the IDE that can *talk to* our Arduino board.


## Workshop Activity 1

For this workshop, get the class together into pairs - one acts as the programmer, and one acts as the robot. The goal of the programmer is to get the robot to prepare and eat a peanut butter sandwich.

The programmer has to write out step by step instructions for what the robot has to do to prepare and eat the sandwich. The instructions have to be as specific as possible, and the robot has to follow the instructions perfectly. If the **programmer** misses a step, the **robot** has to declare it as failed and the pair needs to start again.

**Question**: What did we learn from the exercise? What does it mean to relay instructions perfectly?

## Workshop Activity 2

For this activity, we need to install the [**Arduino IDE**](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software):

### 1.) Go to the Arduino software website

Open your browser and navigate to [the Arduino software website](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). Download the package that corresponds with your operating system (Windows, Mac, etc.)

### 2.) Open and install the package

Follow the instructions on the website to install the software.

### 3.) Open the Arduino IDE

Open the Arduino IDE application. Immediately, you'll see a screen where you can write your instructions.
