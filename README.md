## Outback Hack!

### What this is

Outback Hack is a series of exercises on how to make a soil moisture sensor with an Arduino Kit. Through this training, we will go through programming concepts, and the basic ideas behind electrical engineering and coding.

### What you'll need

For this workshop, you will need:

1x Arduino Uno
1x Breadboard
5x M-to-F jumper cable
1x Soil moisture Sensor
2x Resistors
2x LED
1x USB-D
A laptop with the Arduino IDE installed

### What we'll do

Outback Hack is composed of three primary modules, each covering one particular aspect of programming.

1.) [The Arduino Board - What is programming?](https://github.com/OutbackHack/outbackhack-module/blob/master/1-1-Programming.md)

2.) [Sensor modules - What are inputs? What does it mean to have an output for your program?](https://github.com/OutbackHack/outbackhack-module/blob/master/2-1-Coding-and-Inputs.md)

3.) LEDs - What are parameters and thresholds? How do we make our output useful?

Each of the modules represents an addition into the soil moisture monitor. A soil moisture that you can eventually use to notify you via SMS if your paddock or plants need watering.

If you run into anything, just give your coaches a shout! We'll be happy to help you.
