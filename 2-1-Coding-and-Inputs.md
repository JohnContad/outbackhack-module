Check that you have everything in place. If you're missing anything, raise your hand and talk to any of the coaches.

### Plugin!

Now, take the USB cable and plug your Arduino Uno microcontroller to your computer.

The lights on your board should be lit up by now. Afterwards, open the Arduino IDE:

This will be the baseline by which we'll build our moisture sensor.
